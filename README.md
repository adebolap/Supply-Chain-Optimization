Project Overview
Welcome to the Supply Chain Optimization project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning solution aimed at optimizing supply chain operations for a hypothetical business. The project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making processes.


Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis and modeling.
  - `supply_chain_data.csv`: The primary dataset containing order details, product information, and customer data.

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through different stages of the project.
  - `01_data_loading_and_exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for data loading and initial exploration.
  - `02_data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - `03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - `04_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Notebook for feature engineering.
  - `05_machine_learning_model.ipynb`: Notebook for building and evaluating machine learning models.

- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing and modeling.
  - `data_loading.py`: Script for loading data.
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Script for cleaning data.
  - `eda.py`: Script for exploratory data analysis.
  - `feature_engineering.py`: Script for engineering features.
  - `model.py`: Script for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

- `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the project.

- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

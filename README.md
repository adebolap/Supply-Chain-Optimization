Project Overview
Welcome to the Supply Chain Optimization project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning solution aimed at optimizing supply chain operations for a hypothetical business. The project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making processes.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

data/
|-- supply_chain_data.csv # The primary dataset containing order details, product information, and customer data.

notebooks/
|-- 01_data_loading_and_exploration.ipynb # Notebook for data loading and initial exploration.
|-- 02_data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.ipynb # Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
|-- 03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb # Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
|-- 04_feature_engineering.ipynb # Notebook for feature engineering.
|-- 05_machine_learning_model.ipynb # Notebook for building and evaluating machine learning models.

src/
|-- data_loading.py # Script for loading data.
|-- data_cleaning.py # Script for cleaning data.
|-- eda.py # Script for exploratory data analysis.
|-- feature_engineering.py # Script for engineering features.
|-- model.py # Script for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

- `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the project.

- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
